Introduction:

SQL injection is a type of security exploit that allows attackers to manipulate the SQL statements executed by a web application.It is one of the most 
common and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. In this document, we will cover the basics of SQL injection,
how it works, and how to prevent it.
