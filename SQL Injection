Introduction:

SQL injection is a type of security exploit that allows attackers to manipulate the SQL statements executed by a web application.It is one of the most 
common and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. In this document, we will cover the basics of SQL injection,
how it works, and how to prevent it.

What is SQL Injection?

SQL injection is a technique used to attack web applications that use SQL databases. The goal of SQL injection is to trick the application into executing
SQL statements that the attacker has crafted. This can be done by inserting SQL code into user input fields, such as a login form, search form, or any 
other input field that allows user input to be used in SQL statements.

Example of SQL Injection:

Consider a login page that accepts a username and password. The SQL statement that is executed to check if the user is valid may look like this:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password'

An attacker can enter a specially crafted username and password that will modify the original SQL statement to look like this:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = '' OR 1=1 --

The SQL injection attack added the following code to the original SQL statement:


' OR 1=1 --

This code tells the SQL server to ignore the password field and return all records where the username is empty or where 1 equals 1 (which is always true).
The double dash "--" is used to comment out the rest of the original SQL statement.

This attack will return all records in the users table, effectively bypassing the login mechanism and giving the attacker access to the application.

How to Prevent SQL Injection?

To prevent SQL injection, developers need to properly validate and sanitize all user input. Here are some best practices for preventing SQL injection:

Use parameterized queries: Parameterized queries use placeholders for user input and are executed separately from the SQL statement. This ensures that user
input cannot modify the original SQL statement.

Sanitize all user input: All user input should be sanitized to remove any potential SQL code. This can be done by stripping out any special characters or 
by using a library or framework that handles input sanitization.

Use least privilege: Use database users with the least amount of privilege necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of a successful 
SQL injection attack.

Keep your software up-to-date: Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in newer versions of software. Keep your software up-to-date 

to ensure that you are using the latest security patches.

Conclusion:

SQL injection is a serious security vulnerability that can have devastating consequences for web applications. Developers should be aware of the risks and
take the necessary steps to prevent SQL injection attacks. By following best practices for preventing SQL injection, developers can greatly reduce the risk
of a successful attack.
